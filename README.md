# The ontocomc ontology: A Semantic Framework for Hindemithâ€™s Harmonic System

Ontological representation of music concepts is a growing area of research in both the data science and computational musicology communities. This paper introduces the ontocomc ontology, a scheme that focuses on tone simultaneities, sequences of chords and their automated semantic annotation. Our ontology is based on Paul Hindemith's theory in his Craft of Musical Composition, an original construction completely at odds with traditional tonal harmony. A key characteristic of this scheme is its handling all conceivable simultaneities in a uniform way. This harmonic system has received very little (if any) attention in past data science research; in this sense, our approach constitutes a major novelty, leveraging the representational power of ontologies in conjunction with Hindemith's exhaustive classification of tone simultaneities. Chord sequences and their constituent parts are enriched with semantic features enabling SPARQL querying to capture and analyze distinctive stylistic patterns on the music surface. This process may provide valuable insights on the style, structure or emotional content of a music piece and can be used as part of feature engineering to machine learning applications.
